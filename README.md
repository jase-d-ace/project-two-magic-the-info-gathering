# Turtle Project Two: Magic: the Info Gathering
## by Jason Andrada
My second solo project. This proposal doesn't currently take into account reach goals. These are only MVP features

## Expected Behaviors
* Full CRUD functionality
* Operational API calls to my own API and to the Magic: the Gathering API
* MVC architecture using modularized models, controllers and views
* ReSTful routing convention
* Idea is to be a deck building app

## Perceived Problems
* Time constraints - I don't see this project being particularly DIFFICULT (not to say that it won't be challenging), but my main worry is that this will take a whoooooooooooooooooooooooole lot of time.
* Dual AJAX calls might be a small issue if I'm not careful with which API I'm hitting with each one.
* The Magic: the Gathering API is a little wonky, and the data I get back (according to POSTMAN) is formatted a little strangely
* Two models that work with two tables that will eventually join will be a bit of a challenge.

## Techs used
* Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * for JavaScript, specifically focusing on AJAX (therefore jQuery by extension)
* Back End: Express, Node, PG-Promise, Body-Parser
* Database: pSQL
* Morgan.js as a logging tool to keep track of AJAX calls
